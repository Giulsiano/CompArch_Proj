## Synopsis

This is the project for a course of the University of Pisa which I attended some time ago. It is an academic demonstration of the capabilities of the OPC UA protocol.
Refer to opcfoundation.org for more info.

## Motivation

It is an academic project, so there is no quality check and tests could be not as extensive as a quality project requires. This has been meant only for demonstration purposes.
The code is divided into 2 client and one server which is compliant with the Micro Embedded Server specification you can find at http://opcfoundation-onlineapplications.org/profilereporting/.
I thought the food industry use case but the class and the model I used here doesn't correspond to any particular model on the market. It is pure imagination :).
